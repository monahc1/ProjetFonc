We also added a small tkinter interface for comparison and time complexity analysis (interface.py)

Note to Professor:

We confirm that this project was a collaborative effort, with all team members equally contributing to the development, documentation, and user interface. Each of us was fully engaged in every aspect of the project, ensuring a unified and comprehensive approach.
